NAME
    RTx::S3Invoker - Simple Saved Search Invoker

SYNOPSIS
    The existing options for accessing saved searches in RT have drawbacks:

    Waste time loading a selection in Search Builder before Showing Results.
    Maintain a browser bookmark than can easily get lost or out of sync.
    Clutter the front page/one's dashboard with unneeded subscriptions.
    Worse still, none of these methods is convenient for those who prefer to
    use Simple Search as a command line. S3Invoker provides a powerful
    alternative.

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds a `do:' operator to Simple Search, and provides a brief
    description on Search/Simple.html

    Features of the operator include:

    Directly display search results, or list of searches matching operand.
        S3Invoker tries to 'Do What You Mean'. If it finds exactly one thing
        matching the operand (right-hand side of the colon), it runs that
        search, if there are many matches (Ambiguous search) it lists them
        as clickable links.

        Matching is done with LIKE '%operand%'. Consequently, if no operand
        is supplied, a list of all accessible saved searches is shown.

    BONUS: The ability to access global searches!
        Now it's easy to display any global search, and use it as the basis
        of a custom saved search. Are there things you occassionally need to
        see, but don't want clogging up your home page? Remove "Unowned
        tickets" and call `do:unowned' at your leisure.
