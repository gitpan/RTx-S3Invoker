NAME
    RTx::S3Invoker - Simple Saved Search Invoker

SYNOPSIS
    For power users, accessing saved searches in RT can be rather
    cumbersome. One must either use the search builder to load a search and
    then show results, or maintain a browser bookmark than can easily get
    lost or out of sync. S3Invoker provides an alternative mechanism of
    accessing saved searches in the simple search as command-line style.

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds a `do:' operator to Simple Search, and provides a brief
    description on Search/Simple.html

    Features of the operator include:

    The ability to access global searches.
    Directly display search results, or list of searches matching operand.
        If no operand is supplied, a list of all accessible saved searches
        is given.
