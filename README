NAME
    RTx::From - Make it easier to find users and their tickets

SYNOPSIS
    It can be hard to remember the exact name and email address of a user.
    While powerful, the Configuration/Users search form can be tedious, nor
    is it an obvious location. Therefore this simple plugin:

    Adds a `from:' operator to Simple Search.
        Note that unlike most other operators, which modify ticket queries,
        this operator acts on principals and therefore cannot be
        meaningfully combined with other search terms. The results of doing
        so are undefined and unsupported. However, you may supply multiple
        `from:' terms, which will be OR'd together.

        There is also a work-around if you wish perform a complex query for
        tickets from a fuzzily-remembered reqiestor:

        * Search with `from:'
        * Select "Requested" for the desired user
        * "Edit Search"

    Adds a brief description of the operator, and a link to the native user
    search on Search/Simple.html.
    Adds a sub-tab on a user's profile to a query for his tickets.
